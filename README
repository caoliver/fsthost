Getting Started
---------------

1) ensure you have the necessary build dependencies (devel packages):
  wine
  glib-2.0
  gtk+-2.0 or gtk+-3.0
  jack
  libxml-2.0
  lash-1.0 ( optional )

2) Type 'make'. If everything works correctly this should create an
   executable file called 'fsthost32' and optionaly 'fsthost64'

3) Type 'make GTK2=1' to force GTK+2 GUI

4) On 64bit it may fail with a link error, when it cant find a 32bit lash
   but the 64bit stuff is in place. 
   build yourself a 32bit lash, or:
   make LASH_EXISTS=no

5) To run your vst plugins:
   
      ./fsthost32 /path/to/someplugin.dll
   or
      ./fsthost64 /path/to/someplugin.dll

   and set up the inputs and outputs, eg. using qjackctl's
   'Connections' window.

6) To install type 'make install'

XML Database and simple plugin menu
-----

You can build XML Database, and update it later by such command
fsthost -g ~/VST

Where ~/VST is path which will be scanned recursivelly for plugins.
You can use later this database by some GUI app ( e.g. fsthost_menu ).
Default path for database is ~/fsthost.xml.

Stuff
-----

With LASH you can save and restore the state of the plugin.

There is a first version of midi learn, load/save of midimap
will come tomorrow. i had my beer now and its 5:15
i should be in a club. but i go to bed now.
just press midi learn, move a plugin control and your midi
control.
