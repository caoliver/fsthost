Whats This ?
------------

This is official fork of FST, well what is fst ?
This is a linux vst host. Runs as a jack client.
Uses jack midi input.
Only works for GUI plugins currently.

Supports load/save state to LASH, JackSessions, FXP/FXP files, FPS (XML files)
Supports JackTransport.

Known BUGs
---------------
If you experience WineBUG like RenderBadPicture, please update this ticket:
http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6673

workaround:
export WINEDEBUG=synchronous

Getting Started
---------------

1) ensure you have the necessary build dependencies:

   gtk-devel
   jack-devel
   libxml2
   lash-devel (optional)

2) Type 'make'. If everything works correctly this should create an
   executable file called 'fst'.

3) On 64bit it may fail with a link error, when it cant find a 32bit lash
   but the 64bit stuff is in place. 
   build yourself a 32bit lash, or:
   make LASH_EXISTS=no

4) To run your vst plugins:
   
   ./fst /path/to/someplugin.dll

   and set up the inputs and outputs, eg. using qjackctl's
   'Connections' window.

5) To install copy both fst and fst.exe.so into your $PATH
   (i think they need to be in the same folder)

Stuff
-----

With LASH you can save and restore the state of the plugin.
in order to promote lash i pushed other methods of load/save
pretty much down in my priority list.

There is a first version of midi learn, load/save of midimap
will come tomorrow. i had my beer now and its 5:15
i should be in a club. but i go to bed now.
just press midi learn, move a plugin control and your midi
control.
