Getting Started
---------------

1) ensure you have the necessary build dependencies (devel packages):
  wine
  glib-2.0
  gtk+-2.0
  jack
  libxml-2.0
  lash-1.0

2) Type 'make'. If everything works correctly this should create an
   executable file called 'fsthost32' and optionaly 'fsthost64'

3) On 64bit it may fail with a link error, when it cant find a 32bit lash
   but the 64bit stuff is in place. 
   build yourself a 32bit lash, or:
   make LASH_EXISTS=no

4) To run your vst plugins:
   
      ./fsthost32 /path/to/someplugin.dll
   or
      ./fsthost64 /path/to/someplugin.dll

   and set up the inputs and outputs, eg. using qjackctl's
   'Connections' window.

5) To install type 'make install'

XML Database and simple plugin menu
-----

You build XML Database, and update it later by such command
fsthost -d ~/fsthost.xml ~/VST

Where ~/fsthost.xml is path to database and ~/VST is path which will be
scanned recursivelly for search plugins. You can use later this database
by some GUI app. Default simple script which use zenity or dialog is provided
as fsthost_menu.

Stuff
-----

With LASH you can save and restore the state of the plugin.
in order to promote lash i pushed other methods of load/save
pretty much down in my priority list.

There is a first version of midi learn, load/save of midimap
will come tomorrow. i had my beer now and its 5:15
i should be in a club. but i go to bed now.
just press midi learn, move a plugin control and your midi
control.
